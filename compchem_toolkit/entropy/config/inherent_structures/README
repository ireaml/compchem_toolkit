"Highly unoptimise routine to calculate inherent structures from MD performed at different temperatures. Faster to run optimisations with lammps than ASE"
1. Use read_n_write.py to select and write structures. Alternatively, if using different clusters for the MD and relaxations, can do:
    1. Use read.py in HPC to select structures from dump file
    2. Use write.py to write structures to individual .data files (required to load them in lammps with PBC info)
3. Use lammps_relax.in to relax individual structures to local minima and store in a common dump file

These steps should be performed for a given trajectory at a given temperature (can paralilse with loop over different folders/temps)
